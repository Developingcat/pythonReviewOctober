1. Create a script that takes in user input
    a. It has to check if the number is even or odd (if/else statement?)
    b. If the number is even, it divides it by 2; otherwise (if odd), it'll just print that the number is odd 
2. Make a function to check! It HAS to check if it's even or odd! 
3. Convert to integer, smiley face.
